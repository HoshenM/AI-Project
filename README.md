# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence â€“ Final Project  
**Stroke Prediction using AI & Machine Learning**

This project applies **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, and both **supervised** and **ensemble learning methods** to a healthcare dataset from Kaggle: [Stroke Diagnosis and Health Metrics Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/stroke-diagnosis-and-health-metrics-data).

It explores **risk factors for stroke** through feature analysis, evaluates **14 machine learning models** with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, and validates findings with **statistical significance tests**.  

All outputs are exported as **publication-ready figures and reports** into the `results/` and `figures/` directories.
